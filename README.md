🛠️ The Tech Behind the Magic
We've used some fantastic tools to bring AppointEase to life:

Frontend (What You See & Click!):
React.js: The heart of our user interface, making everything interactive and smooth. ⚛️

Vite: Our lightning-fast build tool. It makes development a breeze! 🚀

Tailwind CSS: We love this for styling! It helps us build beautiful designs super quickly. 🎨

HTML & CSS: The foundational languages that structure and style our web pages. 🌐

Backend (The Brains of the Operation!):
Firebase Functions: Our serverless powerhouse! It handles all the heavy lifting in the cloud. 🔥

Node.js: The runtime environment that powers our backend logic. 🟢

Express.js: A lean and mean framework that helps us build our API endpoints efficiently. ⚡

MongoDB Atlas: Our cloud database! It's super flexible and stores all our app's data. ☁️

Mongoose: This helps Node.js talk nicely to MongoDB. 🐾

bcryptjs: Keeping passwords safe and sound by hashing them! 🔒

jsonwebtoken (JWT): For secure logins and making sure only the right people access certain features. 🔑

dotenv: Keeps our sensitive info (like database passwords) out of sight. 🌍

express-async-handler: Makes error handling in our backend code much cleaner. 🔄

🚀 Let's Get AppointEase Running on Your Machine!
Ready to get your hands dirty? Here’s how to set up and run AppointEase locally.

Before You Start (Prerequisites!)
Make sure you have these installed and ready:

Node.js & npm: Grab them from nodejs.org. We recommend Node.js version 22 or newer.

MongoDB Atlas Account: Head over to cloud.mongodb.com and set up a free account and a new cluster. Don't forget to grab your connection string!

🚨 Super Important for Local Testing (MongoDB Atlas Network Access): You'll need to tell MongoDB Atlas to allow connections from your computer. Go to "Network Access" in your Atlas dashboard and add your current IP address. For local development with Firebase Emulators, it's often easiest to temporarily add 0.0.0.0/0 (Allow Access from Anywhere). Just remember to remove 0.0.0.0/0 when you're done developing for better security!

Firebase CLI: Install this global tool:

npm install -g firebase-tools

Git Bash (Windows): If you're on Windows, this terminal is your best friend for running these commands!

1. Project Setup & Installation (First Time Fun!)
Let's get the code onto your machine and install all the necessary bits.

# 1. Clone this repository (if you haven't already!)
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Student-Teacher-Booking-Appointment

# 2. Install Backend Dependencies (This makes the server side happy!)
cd backend/functions
npm install express cors dotenv mongoose bcryptjs jsonwebtoken express-async-handler
cd ../.. # Back to the main project folder

# 3. Install Frontend Dependencies (This makes the app you see happy!)
cd frontend
npm install
cd .. # Back to the main project folder

2. Backend Configuration (Setting Up the Brains!)
Time to tell our backend where to find the database and how to behave!

2.1. Your Secret .env File (backend/.env)
We need a special .env file right in your backend folder (it's the one above the functions folder) to keep your sensitive info safe.

# Navigate to the backend root directory
cd backend

# Create a .env file (if it doesn't exist yet)
# On Windows: type nul > .env
# On Linux/macOS: touch .env

Now, open this .env file in your favorite text editor and paste this in. Don't forget to replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials!

# backend/.env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://yelmarahul1:rahul123456@cluster0.ny3lolq.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_and_complex_jwt_secret_key_here_e.g._a_very_secure_string_generated_by_a_tool
PORT=5000 # This is just a placeholder port, Firebase Emulators handle the real one

MONGODB_URI: This is your unique connection string from MongoDB Atlas.

JWT_SECRET: Please, please, please change this to a long, random, and super complex string! This is crucial for your app's security. Don't use the example!

PORT: You can usually leave this as is for Firebase Functions.

2.2. Checking Backend index.js for CORS
Open backend/functions/index.js and scroll down to the allowedOrigins list. Just double-check that it includes the port your frontend will run on (http://localhost:5173).

// backend/functions/index.js (a little peek)
const allowedOrigins = [
    'http://localhost:3000',
    'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
    'http://localhost:5173', // <--- This line is super important for local dev!
    // Add your Firebase Hosting domain here when you deploy, like 'https://your-project-id.web.app'
];
// ... the rest of the magic CORS setup ...

If you had to add or change anything, save index.js!

3. Frontend Configuration (Making the App Pretty & Smart!)
Now for the part you'll see! Let's connect the frontend to our backend and ensure the styles are perfect.

3.1. Connecting Frontend App.jsx to the Backend
Open frontend/src/App.jsx and find the API_BASE_URL constant (it's usually around line 100). You need to update this to match the exact "Functions" URL that your Firebase Emulators will give you when they start.

// frontend/src/App.jsx (a little peek)
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5001/YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID/us-central1/api';
// For example: 'http://127.0.0.1:5001/student-teacher-booking-c7c51/us-central1/api'

Remember to swap out YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID with your actual Firebase project ID! Save App.jsx after this change.

3.2. Linking Tailwind CSS in index.html
Make sure your main frontend/index.html file knows where to find the Tailwind CSS. Check its <head> section for this line:

<!-- frontend/index.html (a little peek) -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- ... other important stuff ... -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/tailwind.css"> <!-- This line is CRUCIAL for styles! -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- ... -->
  </body>
</html>

⚙️ The Grand Performance: Running AppointEase!
Alright, it's showtime! You'll need three separate terminal windows open and running at the same time to see everything in action.

Terminal 1: Backend Power-Up (Firebase Emulators 🔥)
This terminal will get your serverless backend, database, and authentication services humming.

# Open a NEW terminal window (e.g., Git Bash)
# Go to your backend functions directory
cd C:/Users/admin/Desktop/Student-Teacher-Booking-Appointment/backend/functions

# Fire up those emulators!
firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore,auth

What to look for: You should see a happy message like MongoDB connected successfully! and All emulators ready!. Also, grab that Functions URL – that's your API_BASE_URL from earlier!

Terminal 2: Frontend App Launch (React App ⚛️)
This terminal will get your beautiful React app ready for action in your web browser.

# Open a NEW, separate terminal window
# Go to your frontend directory
cd C:/Users/admin/Desktop/Student-Teacher-Booking-Appointment/frontend

# Launch the React development server!
npm run dev

What to look for: You'll see VITE vX.Y.Z ready and a ➜ Local: URL (usually http://localhost:5173/). This is the address to type into your browser!

Terminal 3: Tailwind CSS Style Watcher (Frontend Styling 🎨)
This terminal will keep an eye on your code for any Tailwind CSS changes and automatically compile them.

# Open a NEW, separate terminal window
# Go to your frontend directory
cd C:/Users/admin/Desktop/Student-Teacher-Booking-Appointment/frontend

# Start the Tailwind CSS watcher!
npm run tailwind:watch

What to look for: You'll see messages like Rebuilding... Done in Xms., meaning Tailwind is working hard behind the scenes!

🚀 Time to Use AppointEase!
With all three terminals happily running:

Open your web browser and go to the URL from your npm run dev terminal (e.g., http://localhost:5173/).

First things first: Register! Create a new account for each role: a student, a teacher, and an admin. Use different emails for each!

Log In! Try logging in with each of your new accounts.

Explore and Play! Jump into each dashboard and test out all the features we talked about. See how students can book, teachers can manage, and admins can oversee everything!

Troubleshooting (Oops! Something Went Wrong? 🐛)
Don't worry, even the best apps have hiccups! Here are some common issues and how to fix them:

"Error: Cannot find module 'express-async-handler'" (or similar backend module errors):

This usually means a backend package didn't install correctly.

Try this: Go to your backend/functions folder in a terminal and run npm install.

Still stuck? Try a super clean install: cd backend/functions && rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install.

"MONGODB_URI is not defined":

Your backend can't find its database connection string.

Check this: Make sure your .env file is in the backend directory (one level above functions).

Verify: Is the variable named MONGODB_URI (not MONGO_URI)? Is the connection string correct?

"The CORS policy for this site does not allow access from the specified Origin.":

This means your frontend isn't allowed to talk to your backend.

Crucial Fix: Open backend/functions/index.js and ensure http://localhost:5173 is explicitly added to the allowedOrigins array.

Browser Magic: Clear your browser's cache and site data (Ctrl+Shift+Delete in Chrome/Firefox). This is often the hidden culprit!

Restart Everything: Make sure you stop and restart both your backend and frontend servers after making any changes to index.js.

MongoDB Atlas Check: Double-check that your MongoDB Atlas Network Access includes 0.0.0.0/0 (temporarily for development) or your specific public IP.

"MongoDB Connected successfully!" message is missing from Firebase Emulators:

Your backend isn't linking up with your MongoDB Atlas.

Verify: Is your MONGODB_URI in backend/.env exactly right (including username and password)?

Atlas Network Access: Did you add 0.0.0.0/0 to your MongoDB Atlas Network Access and wait for it to become "Active"?
