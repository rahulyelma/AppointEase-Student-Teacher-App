Detailed Wireframe: Student Dashboard
This document provides a low-fidelity, detailed breakdown of the Student Dashboard screen, including layout, key components, and user interactions.

Screen Layout
Header: A simple, fixed header at the top of the screen.

Left: The "AppointEase" logo.

Center: A search bar with a placeholder "Search for a teacher or subject..." This search bar should be persistent across different student screens.

Right: A profile icon (e.g., a circle with the user's initials). Clicking this will reveal a dropdown menu with options like "My Profile," "Settings," and "Log Out."

Main Content Area: The central part of the screen, organized into sections.

Action Button: A prominent, floating "Book New Appointment" button at the bottom right of the screen for quick access.

Key Components & Interactions
1. "Upcoming Appointments" Section
This section is the primary focus of the dashboard, displaying the student's next few appointments.

Heading: "Your Next Appointments"

List of Appointments: A scrollable list of card-like elements. Each card represents a single appointment and contains:

Teacher's Name: Bolded and prominent.

Date & Time: Clear and easy to read (e.g., "Monday, July 15 at 10:00 AM").

Subject: The subject of the appointment (e.g., "Algebra II").

Status Indicator: A small colored icon or text label (e.g., a green checkmark for "Confirmed," an orange hourglass for "Pending Teacher Approval").

Click Interaction: Clicking on an appointment card will navigate the user to a detailed Appointment Details Screen, which would show the full conversation history, a cancellation option, and any notes.

"View All" Button: A button at the bottom of the section to navigate to a dedicated "My Appointments" screen showing a full history of past and upcoming bookings.

Empty State: If a student has no upcoming appointments, this section should display a friendly message like "You have no upcoming appointments." along with a link or button to "Book your first appointment."

2. "Quick Links" Section
A secondary section to provide quick access to common actions.

Heading: "Quick Actions"

Buttons/Icons: A row of well-spaced, clearly labeled icons or buttons.

"Book an Appointment": A direct link to the booking flow.

"My Profile": Takes the user to their profile page to edit personal details.

"Contact Support": Opens an in-app messaging or email client for help.

User Flow

Booking a New Appointment: The user clicks the floating "Book New Appointment" button. This action navigates the user to the Book Appointment Screen.

Viewing Details: The user clicks on an appointment card from the "Upcoming Appointments" list to see the full details of that specific booking.
