System Architecture Overview

The AppointEase application will follow a three-tier architecture model. This is a common and robust design that separates the application into three logical and physical layers: the Presentation Layer, the Logic Layer, and the Data Layer. This separation makes the system easier to develop, manage, and scale.

1. The Presentation Layer (Client Tier)
This is the front-end of the application that users (students and teachers) will interact with directly. It's responsible for the user interface and for sending user requests to the Logic Layer.

Components:

Student Interface: A mobile-first, responsive web application (HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a framework like React) where students can view available slots, book appointments, and see their upcoming schedules.

Teacher Interface: A similar web application for teachers to manage their calendars, approve or decline appointments, and view student information.

2. The Logic Layer (Application Tier)
This is the "brains" of the application. It handles all the business logic, processing user requests, and orchestrating interactions between the Presentation and Data layers.

Components:

API Gateway: All requests from the client-tier will go through this gateway. It will handle authentication and route requests to the appropriate microservice.

Authentication Service: Manages user registration, login, and authorization to ensure only authenticated users can access the application.

Scheduling Service: The core of the application. This service manages time slots, availability, and the process of booking and cancelling appointments.

Notifications Service: Handles sending automated email or in-app notifications to students and teachers for new bookings, reminders, or cancellations.

User Management Service: Stores and manages user-specific data, such as student IDs, teacher details, and contact information.

3. The Data Layer (Database Tier)
This layer is responsible for storing, managing, and retrieving all the application data. It is kept separate from the other layers for security and performance.

Components:

Relational Database: A relational database (like PostgreSQL or MySQL) will be used to store structured data such as user profiles, appointment details, and schedules. The data will be organized in tables with well-defined relationships.

Caching Layer: A caching solution (like Redis or Memcached) will be used to store frequently accessed data, like a teacher's availability, to improve response times and reduce database load.

System Workflow Example: Student Booking an Appointment
A student logs into the Presentation Layer (Student Interface).

The interface sends a request to the API Gateway in the Logic Layer.

The request is routed to the Scheduling Service.

The Scheduling Service queries the Data Layer (Relational Database) to get a list of a teacher's available time slots.

The Scheduling Service updates the database to mark the chosen time slot as "booked" and links it to the student.

The Notifications Service is triggered to send a confirmation email to the student and a notification to the teacher.

A success message is sent back to the Presentation Layer to be displayed to the student.
