A Low-Level Design (LLD) document provides a detailed, component-level breakdown of a software system, serving as a blueprint for developers. It translates a high-level architecture into concrete specifications for each module, class, database table, and API endpoint.

Here is a comprehensive summary of the LLD for the AppointEase application, focusing on key components to illustrate the complete solution design strategy.

### 1. Architectural Overview

The AppointEase application follows a standard **MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack architecture. The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React, communicating with a RESTful API built on Node.js and Express.js. The backend persists data in a MongoDB database.

### 2. Frontend Component Design: The `<AppointmentBooking>` Component

This component is the core UI element for student appointment booking. It handles state, user input, and API calls.

* **Component Name:** `AppointmentBooking`
* **Purpose:** Allows a student to select a teacher, date, and time slot to book an appointment.
* **Props:**
    * `teacherId`: `string` - The ID of the selected teacher.
    * `teacherName`: `string` - The name of the selected teacher.
* **Internal State (`useState` hooks):**
    * `selectedDate`: `string` (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD') - The date chosen by the user.
    * `selectedTime`: `string` (e.g., 'HH:mm') - The time slot chosen by the user.
    * `availableSlots`: `Array<object>` - A list of available time slots fetched from the backend for the `selectedDate`.
    * `isBooking`: `boolean` - A flag to manage UI during API calls (e.g., show a spinner).
    * `message`: `string` - A user-facing message (e.g., "Booking successful!").
* **Component Structure:**
    * **`useEffect` Hook 1:** Triggers on `selectedDate` change to fetch available time slots from the API.
    * **Date Picker:** A UI element for selecting `selectedDate`.
    * **Time Slot Grid:** Renders buttons for each `availableSlots` item. Clicking a button updates `selectedTime`.
    * **Book Button:** A button that, when clicked, initiates the `handleBooking` function. It is disabled if `isBooking` is true or if `selectedTime` is null.
* **Core Logic (`handleBooking` function):**
    1.  Sets `isBooking` to `true`.
    2.  Constructs the payload: `{ studentId: auth.currentUser.uid, teacherId, date: selectedDate, time: selectedTime }`.
    3.  Sends a `POST` request to the `/api/appointments/book` endpoint with the payload.
    4.  On success (`HTTP 201 Created`):
        * Updates `message` to "Appointment booked successfully!".
        * Resets `selectedTime` and fetches updated slots.
    5.  On failure (`HTTP 4xx` or `5xx`):
        * Updates `message` with an appropriate error.
    6.  Sets `isBooking` to `false`.

### 3. Backend API Design: The `POST /appointments/book` Endpoint

This endpoint handles the business logic for creating a new appointment.

* **Endpoint:** `POST /api/appointments/book`
* **Request Method:** `POST`
* **Authentication:** Requires a valid JWT (JSON Web Token) in the request header to verify the user's identity as a student.
* **Request Body:**
    * `studentId`: `string` - The ID of the student.
    * `teacherId`: `string` - The ID of the teacher.
    * `date`: `string` (e.g., '2025-07-15')
    * `time`: `string` (e.g., '14:30')
* **Business Logic:**
    1.  **Validation:**
        * Verify the request body contains all required fields (`studentId`, `teacherId`, `date`, `time`). Return a `400 Bad Request` if any are missing.
        * Validate that `studentId` from the payload matches the `uid` from the JWT token to prevent data tampering.
        * Check that the requested time slot is **still available** in the database.
    2.  **Database Operation:**
        * Create a new document in the `appointments` collection with the provided details.
        * Include a default `status` of 'Pending'.
        * Store the creation timestamp.
    3.  **Response:**
        * On success, return a `201 Created` status with the new appointment document.
        * On failure (e.g., slot already taken), return a `409 Conflict` with an appropriate error message.

### 4. Database Schema Design: The `appointments` Collection

The `appointments` collection stores all appointment-related data.

* **Collection Name:** `appointments`
* **Document Schema:**
    * `_id`: `ObjectId` - Unique ID for the appointment.
    * `studentId`: `ObjectId` - Reference to the student in the `users` collection.
    * `teacherId`: `ObjectId` - Reference to the teacher in the `users` collection.
    * `date`: `Date` - The date of the appointment. 
    * `time`: `string` - The specific time slot (e.g., '14:30').
    * `status`: `string` - Current status of the appointment.
        * **Enum values:** `Pending`, `Confirmed`, `Cancelled`, `Completed`.
    * `createdAt`: `Date` - Timestamp when the appointment was created.
    * `updatedAt`: `Date` - Timestamp of the last update.

### 5. Data Flow Diagram: Booking an Appointment

This sequence diagram illustrates the end-to-end data flow for a successful appointment booking.

1.  **Student (UI):** Clicks the "Book" button in the `<AppointmentBooking>` component.
2.  **Frontend (React):** The `handleBooking` function is executed, sending a `POST` request to the backend.
3.  **Backend (Express.js):**
    * The `POST /appointments/book` route handler receives the request.
    * Middleware validates the JWT token.
    * Business logic validates the request payload and checks slot availability.
4.  **Database (MongoDB):**
    * The backend sends a `create` command to the `appointments` collection.
    * The database creates a new appointment document.
5.  **Backend (Express.js):** The backend receives confirmation and sends a `201 Created` response back to the frontend.
6.  **Frontend (React):**
    * The `handleBooking` function receives the successful response.
    * The component state is updated (`isBooking` to `false`, `message` is set).
    * The UI refreshes to show the booking confirmation.

### 6. Error Handling Strategy

A robust error handling strategy is crucial for a reliable system.

* **Frontend Error Handling:** All API calls within the frontend are wrapped in `try...catch` blocks. Specific error messages received from the backend (e.g., `409 Conflict` for a taken slot) are displayed to the user via the `message` state. A generic error message is shown for unexpected `5xx` server errors.
* **Backend Error Handling:** The backend includes a global error handler middleware. It catches unhandled exceptions and returns a standardized JSON error response (`{ "message": "Internal Server Error" }`) with a `500` status code, preventing the server from crashing. All validation and business logic errors return specific `4xx` status codes with clear messages.
